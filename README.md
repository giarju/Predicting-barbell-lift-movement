# Predicting barbell lift movement
This is the repository for Coursera Data Science Specialization - Practical Machine Learning Project

People can now collect a vast amount of data about their movement during their excercises using a device such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. However, they tend to only observe how much they are doing a particular activity and not how well they are doing it. So the purpose of this study is to train an algorithm to predict wether a certain barbell lift movement is done correctly or not. 

The data used for predicting the movement is from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. From these dataset I train 2 prediction model using gradient boosting method and random forest with 10 fold cross-validation. The resulting model able to achieve an estimated out-of-sample accuracy of 99.3 % for gradient boosting method and 100% for random forest.
